            <h3>Burger</h3>
            <p>Equipment

                Enameled Pot<br>
                Ingredients
                For the Soup:<br>
                1/2 Tablespoon butter
                2 ribs celery , diced
                3-4 large carrots diced
                1 clove garlic , minced
                10 cups chicken stock , or broth*
                1 teaspoon salt , to taste
                ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper , to taste
                1/8 teaspoon dried rosemary ,or more, to taste
                1/8 teaspoon dried sage
                1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
                1 batch homemade egg noodles , or 4 cups dry egg noodles, farfalle or other bite-size pasta
                3 cups rotisserie chicken *
                1 teaspoon better than bouillon chicken flavor , (or more, as needed), or chicken bouillon granules
                Instructions<br>
                
                Add butter, diced celery and carrots to a large stock pot over medium-high heat. Saute for 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another 30 seconds. 
                Add chicken stock and season the broth with rosemary, sage, crushed red pepper, and salt (definitely TASTE the broth before adding more salt), and pepper. Taste and add a spoonful of “better than bullion” chicken or chicken bouillon cubes or granules as needed.
                Bring broth to a boil. Add noodles (either uncooked homemade egg noodles, or dry store-bought pasta) and cook just until noodles are al dente. 
                If using store-bought noodles, be cautious not to overcook them! Remove pot from heat as soon as they are just barely tender. The noodles will continue to cook once you remove the pot from the heat, and you don’t want them mushy. 
                Add chicken meat from the rotisserie chicken. Taste the broth again and add more seasonings, if needed.
                Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 4-5 days, depending on the freshness of the chicken you used.</p>

            <h3>French Fries</h3>
            <p>1. First, grab 1 extra-large potato, 2 large potatoes or 3 medium potatoes equalling about 315 grams. Rinse well in water and then peel the potato.

                TIP: Peeling the potato is optional. While I know some people like the skin on their french fries, I find that it creates a tough exterior. I personally prefer my finger chips to be bare and tender.
                
                peeled potato on a wooden cutting board<br>
                2. Now slice the potato in slices having 1 cm thickness. Before slicing, you can remove the top and bottom part of the potato to get a square or rectangle shaped potato.
                
                TIP: If you are planning on making french fries at home often, there is actually a device called a french fry cutter that will do steps 2-4 for you! That said, I don’t have space in my kitchen for a tool that only achieves one end. Using a knife and cutting board takes a few extra minutes, but isn’t difficult.
                
                peeled potato sliced thinly<br>
                3. Cut the potatoes in sticks having 1 cm width.

                4. Cut the remaining potato slices in sticks as well.

                Soak Potatoes<br>
                5. Rinse these potato sticks for a couple of times in water. Add the rinsed potatoes to a bowl and submerge them in cold water for 30-45 minutes to remove extra starch.
                
                TIP: In a hot and humid climate, keep the bowl in the fridge. For extra crispy fries, soak potatoes in salt water instead.

                6. After 30 minutes or 45 minutes, drain the potatoes in a colander.

                7. Rinse the potatoes with running water. Drain all the extra water.

                8. Then place them on a clean kitchen cotton napkin.

                9. Fold the napkin over to press, pat and dry the potatoes. The potatoes have to be completely dried before you begin to fry them.

            <h3>Hot Chilli Potao</h3>
            <p>
                1. Firstly rinse 3 medium sized potatoes (250 to 275 grams) well in water. Then peel them. Then chop the potato in slices having 0.3 to 0.5 centimetre thickness.

                2. Then cut each slice in sticks having 1 centimetre width.

                3. In a bowl take 3 cups cold water. Place the potatoes in the water for 20 to 30 minutes.

                Prepping other ingredients
                <br>
                4. Meanwhile, when the potatoes are soaking in water, prep the other ingredients. Chop 1 medium sized onion. Finely chop 1 small capsicum (green bell pepper), 4 to 5 medium to large garlic cloves, 1.5 inches ginger and 1 or 2 green chillies. You can even add ⅓ cup spring onion whites instead of onions.

                5. In a small bowl take 2 teaspoons soy sauce (naturally fermented) and 2 teaspoons red chilli sauce or red chilli paste. Do add spicy red chilli sauce and not sweet red chilli sauce.

                6. Mix both the sauces very well and keep aside.
